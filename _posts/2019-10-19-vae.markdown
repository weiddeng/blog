VAE learns from data, and tries to show what generates the data. A datapoint is in general high dimensional, and mixes signal and noise, so it is hard to capture what is going on. If we believe there is a low dimensional space that captures the data, then we can use VAE. Let us use X to

VAE is a model, a computation graph.
